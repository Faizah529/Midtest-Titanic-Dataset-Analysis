# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis

This project is use-case python using titanic dataset

The dataset contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived (S), their age (A), their passenger-class (C), their sex (G) and the fare they paid (X). 

Objection of this project is data wraggling.
